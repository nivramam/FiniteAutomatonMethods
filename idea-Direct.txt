The idea for the Direct method is to build the syntac tree. From that we will find the firstpos, lastpos and followpos. This followpos will help in finding the states - the optimized number of states that are in the resulting DFA. 

For building syntax tree, basic operations of a tree is needed - this is provided by the BTree.java functionality. BTree is helpful in genraating the tree nodes.
