The idea for the Direct method is to build the syntac tree. From that we will find the firstpos, lastpos and followpos. This followpos will help in finding the states - the optimized number of states that are in the resulting DFA. 

For building syntax tree, basic operations of a tree is needed - this is provided by the BTree.java functionality. BTree is helpful in genraating the tree nodes. 

confusion on nullable --- 
->>>>>  has 5 ctegories -  1. leaf : false
                            2. non-leaf :
                                        a. E node(epsilon) - true
                                        b. concat - nullable(c1) & nullable(c2)
                                        c. or - nullable(c1) | nullable(c2)
                            3. '*' node - true
